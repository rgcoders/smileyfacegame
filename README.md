# Smiley Face Matching Game

**Goal**<br>
Players have to select the extra face on the left hand side.

**Overview**<br>
A JavaScript-based game that dynamically adds content based on user activity.

**Key Activities**<br>
I use the JavaScript random() Method to place the smiley faces in random positions. I used an "onclick" Event Handler to allow the user to interact with the web page. The game gets progressively harder - and more fun! - the more you play. 

**JavaScript Elements Used**<br>

- random() Method
- "onclick" Event Handler
- While loop
- Variable Scope: Global/local variables
- Dynamic images: document.createElement("img")
- Removing / Appending Children to the DOM (Document Object Model).
- "null" primitive value to cancel a player's errant mouse clicks

Enjoy!
